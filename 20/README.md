# Day 20

The description talking about the cheat lasting for 2 nanoseconds can be interpreted that you can 
travel through 2 wall blocks. 
After careful reading, it really means at the 2nd nano second, you must be back on the path so
you can only travel through 1 wall block.

### Part b struggles
* Didn't realize the cheat path can also go on '.'

### Part b wrong ansers
* 883350 - too low
* 1104707 - too high
